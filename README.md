# Mining the Performance History of the New York Philharmonic from 1842-2015: Programming Trends and Performer Networks

The recent release into the public domain of historical concert program data in XML format by the New York Philharmonic affords the opportunity of diachronic analysis of musical practice in the city, as reflected in the selected pieces performed and records of the participating performers themselves.

The historical concert program data published by the New York Philharmonic upon which this poster is based is available free of restrictions under the Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Dedication http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

The Metadata is maintained by the New York Philharmonic Leon Levy Digital Archives team who have released many interesting datasets relating to the history of the orchestra [http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/open-data](over the last number of years).
